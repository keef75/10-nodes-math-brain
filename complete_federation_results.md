## Validation Summary

### Mathematical Verification
1. **Factorization**: x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3) ✅
2. **Zero-Product Property**: (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0 ⇒ x = -2 or x = -3 ✅
3. **Discriminant**: Δ = 5² - 4(1)(6) = 25 - 24 = 1 > 0 (two distinct real roots) ✅
4. **Direct Substitution**: 
   - (-2)² + 5(-2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0 ✅
   - (-3)² + 5(-3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0 ✅
5. **Vieta's Formulas**: Sum = -2 + (-3) = -5 ✅, Product = (-2)(-3) = 6 ✅

### Cross-Node Agreement
- **High Consensus**: 7 out of 9 specialized nodes provided explicit solutions
- **Consistent Results**: All explicit solutions matched: x = -2 and x = -3
- **Multiple Validation Methods**: Algebraic, geometric, calculus, number theory, symbolic
- **No Contradictions**: All approaches converged on the same answer
