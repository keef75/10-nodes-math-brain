# 10 Nodes Math Brain - Project Documentation

## Overview

The "10 Nodes Math Brain" is a sophisticated mathematical problem-solving federation system that uses multiple specialized AI agents (nodes) to analyze mathematical problems from different perspectives. The system follows a distributed intelligence architecture where each node specializes in a specific mathematical domain and contributes to a collaborative solution process.

2. **Combinatorics**: "How many ways can 8 people sit around a circular table?"
3. **Geometry**: "Find the area of a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (3,4), (6,0)"
4. **Algebra**: "Solve the system: 2x + 3y = 7, 4x - y = 5"
5. **Analysis**: "Find the limit of (sin x)/x as x approaches 0"

## Performance Characteristics

- **Execution Time**: Depends on problem complexity and API response times
- **API Calls**: 10 OpenAI API calls per problem (one per node)
- **Token Usage**: Optimized prompts with structured output to minimize costs
- **Memory Usage**: Low memory footprint, processes sequentially

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Parallel Processing**: Execute independent nodes in parallel
2. **Caching**: Cache results for similar problems
3. **Interactive Mode**: Allow user feedback during analysis
4. **Additional Domains**: Add specialized nodes for statistics, topology, etc.
5. **Visualization**: Generate mathematical diagrams and plots
6. **Performance Metrics**: Track accuracy and reasoning quality over time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing API Key**: Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set
2. **Import Errors**: Verify all node files are in the same directory
3. **JSON Parse Errors**: Check OpenAI API response format
4. **File Not Found**: Some nodes may fail if previous outputs are missing

### Debugging

- Check individual node output files for detailed analysis
- Review console logs for error messages and execution progress
- Verify API key permissions and usage limits
